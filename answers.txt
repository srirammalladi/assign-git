• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?


1.) gitignore file is used to ignore some specific files when working on a project, it should include jar, war, ear and other package related files when opted for java

2.) fast forward means moves the source branch pointer to target without making an extra commit

3.) when working on a project everyone involved in can work simultaneously on different parts irrespective of the progress in other branches.

4.) depending on the size of the project you can have multiple repositories and one named origin
